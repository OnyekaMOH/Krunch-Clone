    <h2 class="Our_aims">Our Aims</h2>
    <p>
        The aim of all our services is to offer support, guidance and encouragement to young people thereby enabling them to fulfill their potential. Our Personal Development and Life Skills programme is tailored by our staff to suit each young person’s situation and current issues. As well as giving young people the space to talk, we also guide them through units of work which can be accredited by the examining body, OCN West Midlands. These units of work are part of the QCF and we often combine units which focus upon emotional health and wellbeing with practical activities, such as cooking, art and design and computer based music. For those students who cannot access Entry Level 3 qualifications, we can still offer a wide variety of similar units which are accredited by the AQA Unit Award Scheme.
    </p>
<h2 class="a_our_s">When can you access our services?</h2>
<p>
    We are able to work with young people both on Krunch premises and at other suitable venues. We work with young people during weekdays to provide alternative education and mentoring. Please call to enquire about current session availability. We also run youth provisions on some evenings.
</p>

<h2 class="r_2_our_s">Who can you refer to our services?</h2>
<p>
    During week days, we mainly work with young people aged between 9 and 19 years (up to 25 yrs – for additional needs) who need extra support in some area of their life. This may present as a lack of emotional health and well being or maybe as difficult or challenging behaviour. Referring agencies often cite such issues as barriers to progression in education, employment and training.  We also have experience of working with a variety of Special Educational Needs.

To request a referral form, please call Lynsey our Services Manager or Mark Cavell, Services Coordinator – on 0121 552 5556 or email <span class="mark_2_blue"></span> mark@krunch.org.uk
